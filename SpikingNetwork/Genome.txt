Genomes are constructed out of several different chromosomes, which can be expanded to meet different needs

Currently, genomes are constructed of
	- Chromosome 1: Neurons
	- Chromosome 2: Connections

Networks can also store mental states, and as such genomes may have an optional third chromosome
	- Chromosome 3: Mental state

this document uses some shorthand documented below:
	b - boolean flag
	i - integer
	f - float
	0 - empty values
	[xby] - x bits of data type y 
	[xBy] - x bytes of data type y
	[xyi]*[uvw] - [xyi] sequences of [uvw] data

Chromosomes contain genes of fixed size, for the entire length of the chromosome
Each chromosome contains a different type of gene, detailed below:
	- Neuron Gene [1bb][1bb][6b0][4Bf][4Bf]
		- Section 1: Neuron type bit. 0 = Spiking, 1 = Capacitor
		- Section 2: Neuron output type bit. 0 = depressive, 1 = potentiating
		- Section 3: Six empty bits. if you need more bit flags, put them here
		- Section 4: Four bytes, Controlling the membrane resistance
		- Section 5: Four bytes, Controlling the spike potential threshold offset
	- Connection Gene [1bb][1bb][6b0][4Bi][4Bi][4Bf]
		- Section 1: Source type bit. 0 = Input Neuron, 1 = Internal Neuron
		- Section 2: target type bit. 0 = Internal Neuron, 1 = Output Neuron
		- Section 3: Six empty bits. if you need more bit flags, put them here
		- Section 4: Four Bytes, controling the source index
		- Section 5: Four Bytes, controling the target index
		- Section 6: Four Bytes, controlling the weight 
					 final weight ranges from 0.0 to 4.0. negative weights are expressed by the source neuron being depressive
	- Mental Gene [4Bf][8Bi]
		- Section 1: Four Bytes, controling the value to initialise the neuron with
		- Section 2: Eight Bytes, The time, in hundredths of milliseconds(s^-5) since the neuron last spiked
		
in addition, the neuron chromosome contains some additional data at the start not fitting a gene
[4Bi]*[4Bi]
	- Section 1: the number of lobes in the network
	- Section 2: the number of neurons in the lobe for each lobe in the network
