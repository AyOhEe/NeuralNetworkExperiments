Genomes are constructed out of several different chromosomes, which can be expanded to meet different needs

Currently, genomes are constructed of
	- Chromosome 1: Neurons
	- Chromosome 2: Connections

Networks can also store mental states, and as such genomes may have an optional third chromosome
	- Chromosome 3: Mental state

Chromosomes contain genes of fixed size, for the entire length of the chromosome
