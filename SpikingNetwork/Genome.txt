Genomes are constructed out of several different chromosomes, which can be expanded to meet different needs

Currently, genomes are constructed of
	- Chromosome 1: Neurons
	- Chromosome 2: Connections

Networks can also store mental states, and as such genomes may have an optional third chromosome
	- Chromosome 3: Mental state

Chromosomes contain genes of fixed size, for the entire length of the chromosome
Each chromosome contains a different type of gene, detailed below:
	- Neuron Gene [1b][1b][6eb][2B]
		- Section 1: Neuron type bit. 0 = Spiking, 1 = Capacitor
		- Section 2: Neuron output type bit. 0 = depressive, 1 = potentiating
		- Section 3: Six empty bits. if you need more bit flags, put them here
		- Section 4: Two bytes, Controling the neuron bias
	- Connection Gene [1b][1b][6eb][4B][4B][2B]
		- Section 1: Source type bit. 0 = Input Neuron, 1 = Internal Neuron
		- Section 2: target type bit. 0 = Internal Neuron, 1 = Output Neuron
		- Section 3: Six empty bits. if you need more bit flags, put them here
		- Section 4: Four Bytes, controling the source index
		- Section 5: Four Bytes, controling the target index
		- Section 6: Two Bytes, controlling the weight 
					 final weight ranges from 0.0 to 4.0. negative weights are expressed by the source neuron being depressive
	- Mental Gene [4B][4B]
		- Section 1: Four Bytes, controling the value to initialise the neuron with
		- Section 2: Four Bytes, The time since the neuron last spiked
